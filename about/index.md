### What’s it all about?
This blog is my effort to share some real world examples of blue team security put in to practice. 

There are a ton of sites dedicated to hacking and red team activities but very little for us on the blue team.

Where I have implemented other people’s ideas I will endeavour to provide links and references to the source material. If I miss anything feel free to email me on the address below and I will sort it out. Likewise if you have any questions or comments you can also email using the email address below.
