<!-- Description of article -->
Getting a Powershell script to run from a group policy object (GPO) should be easy.  You should be able create a GPO, go to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Scripts > Startup (or Shutdown) and enter the path to your script on the PowerShell Script tab.  
For some reason I have found that this doesn’t work every time.

I find the following configuration to be more reliable.

#### Example Configuration
In your GPO go to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Scripts > Startup (or Shutdown) and select the Scripts tab (**not the PowerShell Scripts tab**).

Set the Script Name field to be:
`windir System32WindowsPowerShellv1.0 powershell.exe`
