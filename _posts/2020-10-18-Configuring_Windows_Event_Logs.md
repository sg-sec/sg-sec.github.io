To start-off my security blog I thought I would discuss logging, alerting and some automated response.

To be truely effective at monitoring and responding to your logs you are going to have to centralise them. Before setting up a centralised logging solution you are going to have to make sure that you are collecting the right logs.  Today's blog focuses on configuring Windows event logs.

ToDo:
Discuss LogMD for post configuration changes.
Implement applying changes with GPO
Check pre configuration with LogMD
